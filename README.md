# 🚀 Competitive Programming

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository!  
This is where I collect my solutions, notes, and templates while practicing problem-solving across different platforms.  
The goal is to sharpen problem-solving skills, improve algorithmic thinking, and build a solid reference for future contests.

## ✨ Features
- 📝 Well-structured solutions in **C++** (and sometimes Python).  
- ⚡ Fast I/O and reusable templates for contests.  
- 📚 Notes on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.  
- 🔥 Problems from multiple platforms (Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank, AtCoder, etc.).  
- 🎯 Focus on **clean, readable, and optimized** code.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- Data Structures (Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps)  
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking)  
- Bit Manipulation & Number Theory  
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Floyd–Warshall, Union-Find)  
- Advanced topics (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Binary Search on Answer, etc.)
