What is Programming?
---------------------

At its core:
Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform specific tasks.
- Just like you give a recipe to a cook,
- In programming, you give step-by-step instructions (a program) to a computer.

Formal definition:
Programming is the act of designing and writing code (in languages like C++, Python, Java, etc.) that tells a computer what to do and how to do it.

Why we need programming:
- Computers are fast but dumb — they can’t “think” on their own.
- Programming lets humans express logic, solve problems, and automate tasks using a language computers understand.

Example:
If you want a computer to add two numbers:

- In English: “Take 5 and 7, then show me their sum.”
- In Python (a programming language):
    print(5 + 7)

Analogy:
Think of programming like teaching a robot:
- You break a task into small steps,
- Write those steps in a language it understands,
- And the robot follows them exactly — no guessing, no skipping.
